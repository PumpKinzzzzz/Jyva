# Jyva
Jyva is a minimalist image transformation toolkit inspired by the aesthetic of Low-tech Magazine. It allows you to convert images into compressed monochrome PNGs using grayscale quantization, customizable dithering algorithms (like Floydâ€“Steinberg), and optional color tinting. Ideal for eco web design.
